# quick_passwordCreater
It can generate a strong password quickly, as long as it get the  length of the password you want.

ðŸ˜ŽAdditional, the result will be recorded in 'out.txt' file. 

---

ðŸ˜¢This project is no longer mantained, because I got a better idea --- build a CLI tool to create password with python! It can:

1. Custom the length of password
2. Custom the character set of password
3. more features ...

To access that project, please move to [passwordCreater](https://github.com/VsKendo/passwordCreater) .

# quick start

All you need to do is compile it and run it in the console like this:

```shell
./pswCreater
```

and then input a number( assume I input 10):

```shell
input the lenth of password: 10
```

Password generated successfully:

```shell
complete! your password is: @jMt>ycY)M

this result will be written into out.txt 
please remember to save it, good bye
```

Last but no least, you can find the result in the 'out.txt' file.
